<p> A few years ago I had started listening to Metallica with the first song I had listened to being Whiplash, since then, they have become one of my favorite bands and something that I know a lot about. There is some information about Metallica that you have to go to different sites for so by me putting all of what I want on one website, I can easily access the information I want when I need it. So feel free to rummage around my website. Make fun of my reviews, correct me on the slightest detail on my brief history or critisise me and what I think were important points for the band. Do what you like! </p>
