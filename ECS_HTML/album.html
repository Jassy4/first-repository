<h3> Kill 'Em All </h3>
<p>This is what started it all. Well, I suppose their tapes were but that's not important. In 1983 Metallica released Kill 'Em All. This album is probably their fastest and rawest album and it is also one of the two albums that feature writing credits from Dave Mustaine even though he told the band not to use his riffs. This album is what got me into Metallica and I still listen to it often, there is no bad song on this album. The fast paced "Hit the Lights" gets you going and the bass solo of Anesthesia is some brilliant work. <br>

Best Song: Metal Militia</p>

<h3> Ride The Lightning </h3>
<p> Metallica's 1984 sophomore album, "Ride the Lighting" is my personal favorite. Anything you want is on this album, if you like instrumentals, they've got "The Call of Cthulhu." If you like fast paced thrash, they've got "Fight Fire with Fire." If you like ballads, they've got "Fade to Black" and etc. This album is also produced a lot better than their previous album was since they were signed onto a better label. This album als made them get out of the country as they started to tour around the world more regularly. <br>

<h3>Master Of Puppets</h3>


<p> In 1986 Metallica would release "Master of Puppets." This would be Cliff Burton's last album before his death at age 24. This album is argued to be the best Thrash Metal album of all time and it lands at #2 on Rolling Stone's top 100 heavy metal albums. This album is another one with no flaws from start to finish. Even though it's not my favorite, it is the most well put together and their best work. <br>

<h3> ...And Justice For All</h3>

<p> After the tragic death of Burton, Metallica hired Jason Newsted and went right back to work. This was somewhat of their farewell to thrash even if they didn't know it at the time. There are a couple of tracks that aren't my favorite but this is still and outstanding album. The biggest problem is the production, the guitars, drums and vocals all sound great but the bass track is at a 0. You can't hear the bass. That itself makes it lose one point. This album also came in second place for a grammy award. <br>

<h3> Metallica </h3>

<p> In 1991, "Metallica" was released but it is now more known as the black album. This album jumped them from being big in the heavy metal world, to being gods in the music world. With tracks like "Enter Sandman" and "Nothing Else Matters" that are still played on the radio all the time, it's no wonder they jumped up that high. Although I would consider this a hard rock album, it is still a wonderful piece of work. <br>

Best Song: Holier Than Thou </p>

<h3> Load and ReLoad </h3>

<p> I'm gonna do "Load" and "ReLoad" together because they are pretty much just 1 and 2. The thing these albums are is that they are good, but since this was so different from what people liked about Metallica, it was bad. If any other band in the 90s had released this, it would have been top of the charts, but since Metallica did, they weren't that far up. Both of these together have very strong tracks. <br>

<h3> S&M </h3>

<p> I'm not doing any compilations or any other live albums besides this. In 1999 "S&M" was released and this was groundbreaking. This showed the world the heavy metal wasn't just noise when Metallica teamed up with the San Francisco Symphony. Heavy metal was music just like how classical music is, and when they are combined, it makes for one hell of a concert. The only reason it has points marked off is because there are some songs they played that weren't my favorite. <br>

<h3> St. Anger </h3>

<p> Things were just not good with Metallica in the early 2000s. Newsted left, the Napster incident, the band was falling apart, and then the 2003 release of "St. Anger." This is definitely not their best work. There aren't any guitar solos and the snare doesn't have the actual snare piece that makes it rattle so it sounds like a stockpot. The documentary about this album is better than the album itself. <br>
Rating: 3/10 <br>
Best Song: St. Anger </p>

<h3> Death Magnetic </h3>

<p>Metallica decided to go back to what made them popular; thrash metal. In the 2008 release of Death Magnetic, Metallica started to try and return to what they used to be gods at, and they showed that they've still got it. Now it definitely isn't their best album, in fact not anywhere close, but it's still a good album. The production is a little strange though. <br>

Best Song: Cyanide </p>

<h3> Hardwired To Self-Destruct </h3>

<p>Finally we get to their most recent album, released in 2016, "...Hardwired to Self-Destruct. This album is honestly really good and it would've been my favorite metal album of 2016 but their old friend Dave Mustaine and Megadeth had "Dystopia." This album starts of strong with the title track and it immediately reminds you of old school Metallica, which is a very good thing to hear. <br>
Rating: 8/10 <br>
Best Song: Spit Out the Bone </p>
