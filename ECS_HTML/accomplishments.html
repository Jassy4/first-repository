<h3> Thrash Metal </h3>

<p> One of the first big accomplishments that Metallica made was that they were the first Thrash Metal band to get their album recorded, produced, published and sold. The release of Kill 'Em All not only made thrash metal a real subgenre, it provided many bands to record thrash albums of their own such as Slayer, Bathory, Suicidal Tendencies and Megadeth. Without this album, the popularization of the genre could have been delayed for many years.

<h3> #1 Selling Thrash Album </h3>

<p> With the release of Master of Puppets, Metllica certified them as gods in the heavy metal world, at least for the thrash metal scene. Now after almost 36 years since the release of the album, it is still selling and it's the highest sold thrash album of all time. Master of Puppets is also inducted into the national recording registry and it is now preserved by congress as well.

<h3> First Heavy Metal Grammy </h3>

<p> In 1989, one year after the release of ...And Justice For All, the grammy awards created an award for heavy music and Metallica was nominated and the favorite to win. Metallica even performed "One" for the crowd. The problem is that Hard Rock was considered for this award so Jethro Tull pulled off the upset. This is a very conterversial topic, even today. Metallica would end up winning the award a year later when it was changed to "Best Metal Performance."

<h3> #1 Heavy Metal Album </h3>

<p> With the release of the 1991 album, "Metallica" or known as the "Black Album" now, Metallica would jump to world dominance. The album has sold over 110 million copies in the 30 year life it has had. The album is also the most sold heavy metal album of all time, even if some people may consider it hard rock and not heavy metal. The album presented the band with a bunch of oppurtunites such as the next event.

<h3> Concert in Moscow U.S.S.R </h3>

<p> Months before the fall of the Soviet Union, they held a concert on an airfield in Moscow with over 1 million in attendence. Metallica performed with Pantera and AC/DC for the first major foreign concert in over 50 years. The band got to play in one of the biggest dictatorships and just months later, they broke apatt and became their own countries, hopefully it stays like that.

<h3> S&M </h3>
<p> In 1999, Metallica teamed up with the San Fransisco Symphony and performed a live concert together that was later released as an album. The concert showed the world that Metal isn't just screaching guitars and yelling, it is a form of music. Whether you like it or not, Heavy Metal is a musci genre. Metallica would do another concert with the San Fransico Symphony in 2019 and they also released an album for that concert aswell.

<h3> Rock and Roll Hall of Fame </h3>
<p> In 2009, just 3 years after one of their biggets inspirations (Black Sabbath) was inducted in to the Rock Hall, Metallica would join them as Flea presented them onto the stage. Metallica was joined by former member Jason Newsted when accepting the awards and Cliff Burton's Father was there to accept it in his honor. Dave Mustaine wasn't there which became an argument even though Dave didn't care despite him writing 7 songs for the band. <p>
